<div class="video_paragraph_header"> If you want access to new, never-before-seen videos, make sure to purchase a subscription every now and then. This keeps the site alive and incentivizes more content production. (The community section has videos sent in by users and found publicly.) We have a specific library with videos sourced directly for the website. When you subscribe, you both support the site and gain access to that library.</div>
